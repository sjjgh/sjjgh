# Hi, I'm Jiajie Shi 👋

I am a Data Scientist and independent researcher with a Ph.D. in Mathematics (Computational Science).
My work focuses on the intersection of **graph machine learning**, **network geometry**, and **biological data modeling**.

## 🔬 Research Interests
- Graph similarity, network geometry, and hyperbolic embeddings  
- Social and complex networks  
- General machine learning and generative models  
- Multimodal single-cell foundation models  

## 📚 Notes & Writing
More research notes, ideas, and blog-style articles will be released soon.
